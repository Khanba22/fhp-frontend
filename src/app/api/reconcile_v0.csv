Essential utilities, including the transformer, metering, gas supply, lightning protection, and fire alarm system, are present on-site; however, their condition and compliance must be rigorously assessed to identify potential liabilities.

The electrical sub-metering infrastructure appears compliant with the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), indicating functionality for billing; however, a comprehensive review of calibration records is recommended to confirm ongoing accuracy and prevent future disputes.

While the Property maintenance team has verbally asserted no historical leaks in closed water systems, this remains unverified. The absence of documented evidence presents an inherent risk, and the purchaser should factor in potential liabilities associated with undocumented system integrity.

A significant future capital liability exists due to the prevalence of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants within the systems. Restricted production and a mandated phase-down of high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants, including R404A (phased out since January 2020), will inevitably lead to decreased availability and substantial price increases. The purchaser will inherit a direct exposure to significant replacement or retrofit costs in the near to medium term.

A critical documentation gap and potential operational risk were identified. The absence of chemical and microbiological certification for closed loop systems precludes any assessment of water quality. This directly indicates a potential for poor water quality, which could necessitate significant, unbudgeted remediation costs to achieve acceptable operational standards and regulatory compliance.","The language emphasizes 'liabilities,' 'risks,' and 'significant costs' from the buyer's perspective.

The electrical sub-metering system indicates compliance with the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), thereby supporting verifiable billing practices. This contributes positively to the asset's financial transparency and operational consistency.

Reliance on anecdotal assurance from the Property maintenance team regarding the absence of historical leaks within closed water systems represents an unquantified risk. The lack of verifiable documentation prevents a definitive assessment of asset integrity concerning these critical systems.

The presence of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants introduces a discernible financial and regulatory risk to the asset. Legislative restrictions on HFC production and market placement, coupled with the ongoing phase-out of high GWP refrigerants such as R404A (since January 2020), will foreseeably impact operational expenditure and equipment viability. This necessitates a proactive assessment of long-term capital exposure related to essential cooling infrastructure.

A material compliance and operational risk is presented by the unavailability of chemical and microbiological certification for closed loop systems.

The Property maintenance team has advised that no history of leaks has been observed in the closed water systems. We recommend reviewing available historical maintenance logs and considering a system integrity check to confirm this and inform future preventative maintenance.

The existing cooling systems utilize hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, which are subject to regulatory phase-down and increasing cost due to production restrictions.

The Property maintenance team reports no history of leaks within the closed water systems, indicating a well-maintained operational history for this critical infrastructure.

While the current cooling systems utilize hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, it is important to note the industry trend towards phasing out high GWP refrigerants like R404A (phased out since January 2020). This presents an opportunity for a future owner to upgrade to more environmentally sustainable and modern cooling technologies, potentially enhancing long-term operational efficiency.
